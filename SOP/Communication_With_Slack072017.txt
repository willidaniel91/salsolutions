#### Communication With Slack

---
All work related communications between employees should be done in slack. Using _slack_ and its many extensions, you can assign tasks to yourself or other employees and its daily standup functionality will allow all employees to better track progress as well as productivity.

##### Sal Solutions slack Group

* the slack group address is [salsolutions.slack.com](salsolutions.slack.com)

#### busybot usage
busybot is used as a collaborative to-do list where everyone can assign either themselves or other people tasks to. You can set a due date, set subtasks and much more. Our use of busybot will, for the moment, be limited to simple assignments and tracking of tasks.
