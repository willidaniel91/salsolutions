#### Converting markdown to PDF file using markdown-pdf
---
Converting a .txt file in markdown is easily done using markdown-pdf.

##### MAC or Linux

1. Open up a terminal window.
2. Using __npm__, install markdown-pdf:

```bash
$npm install -g markdown-pdf
```

3. Make sure the file in question ends with a .txt or .md (* being any string of characters)

4. Back in the terminal window:
```bash
$markdown-pdf /path/to/markdown
```
* replace _/path/to/markdown_ with the actual path to the .txt file that you wish to convert to pdf.
