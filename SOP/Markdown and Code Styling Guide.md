#### How to use Markdown

Markdown is a very easy to use text formatter. We will be using markdown (files ending in .md) to create/edit docs and SOP as needed. Under this is a cheatsheet that has every major markdown elements you will be using.

Keep in mind that, converting a .md file to a .pdf file is very easy and you can refer to

#### Standard Operating Procedures
* Following SOPs when achieving tasks will allow other team members to carry on where you left off and will make it easier for any possible corrections in the future that may need to be made.
* When tackling _new_ tasks of any sort, take notes and write down the entire process
