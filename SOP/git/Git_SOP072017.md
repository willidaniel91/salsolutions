#### Basic git guide

---
Git is a crucial tool for programming and any kind of collaborative work that involves *source code* of any kind. It is one of several tools used for version control systems (VCS) available on the internet.

Though there are more git commands and combination of commands than I care to list, I would say that about 80% of all future git commands you will write will only be limited to less than 20% of all git commands available to you.

[atlassian.com](https://github.com/willidaniel91/salsolutions/blob/master/SOP/slack/Communication_With_Slack072017.md#acknowledgement-procedure) offers a phenomenal tutorial on git using BitBucket that I am requiring everyone to complete. Follow along the tutorial all the way through the end of **"Advanced Tips"** for a solid understanding of git and version control in general.


#### Git Cheatsheet
Here is a git cheatsheet with all the most commonly used git commands for your referral:
