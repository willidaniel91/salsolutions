#### Communication With Slack

---
All work related communications between employees should be done in slack. Using _slack_ and its many extensions, you can assign tasks to yourself or other employees and its daily standup functionality will allow all employees to better track progress as well as productivity.

##### Sal Solutions slack Group

* the slack group address is [salsolutions.slack.com](salsolutions.slack.com)

#### busybot usage
busybot is used as a collaborative to-do list where everyone can assign either themselves or other people tasks to. You can set a due date, set subtasks and much more. Our use of busybot will, for the moment, be limited to simple assignments and tracking of tasks:

* **Please do confirm with any sort of reply if you have received a task**
  * a simple acknowledgement such as an emoji or a text response such as "understood" will do

#### limibot usage
Everyday at 9pm local time (subject to change), every employee is expected to participate in the standup meeting via limibot. The process is pretty straight forward and all you need to do is honestly answer a series of questions.

* the details of every employee will be available on the *__#standup__* channel on slack.

* please include as much detail as possible and do not worry about any mistakes in grammar or spelling.
