#### Project Description

The new monthly subscription-based model of offering several *packages* of hand-picked wine selections will shift the main focus of the business from directly selling to customers via a brick-and-mortar retail shop and a online store to shipping to paying subscribers at a fixed date every month. This will essentially be an addition--albeit a *significant* one--to the existing services offered by the business.

##### Need for service

The brick-and-mortar shop is currently experiencing a slow-down in customer traffic and many of the functions of the existing website are faulty if not downright dysfunctional. A shift in focus to a subscription-based model will offer a lot more flexibility in managing stock as well as increasing the profit margin through proper packaging and effective marketing. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) along with effective use of social media marketing on *instagram* and similar technology should drive up traffic (both paying and non-paying) to not only the subscription-based side of the product but also the existing website.

##### Project Purpose & Scope

This project will be strictly limited to the development and subsequent SEO of the subscription-based website for WrightBoxWines any additional features/functions will take place in later iterations of the project after careful study and consideration of available options.
