#### Ruby Style Guide

---
As with all other languages we will be using, we will adopt a style guide that all developers must adhere to. The principle behind this is simple: consistent and clear code allows any member of the team to pick up exactly where another team member previously left off. In other words, consistent code style (regardless of the language in question) makes collaborative work **much** easier.

Here are some basic guidelines to follow for Ruby:

* Soft tabs: 2 spaces, convert tabs to spaces

* class names: CamelCase

  * ThisIsCamelCase

* file names and method names: snake_case

  * this_is_snake_case.rb

Create and assign a variable with a long name like this: my_new_variable = "Create long named variables like this"
